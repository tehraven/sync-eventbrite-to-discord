# Setup

You need to create a Discord Bot and add that Bot to your Discord server.
You also need to have access to your EventBrite account to create an API Key (as yourself)

## Discord Bot

1. https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create New Application
3. General Info - Just add the App Icon, Name, and Description. Take note of the Application ID.
4. OAuth2 - You don't need this unless you are using your bot with external toosl like Integromt (they'll help you, if so)
5. Bot - Enable all Priviledged Gateway Intents (If you expand this code you will thank me later). Click the Reset Token and store that token in the `.env` file as `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
6. Browse to `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id={BOT ID FROM STEP 3}&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands` - note the `BOT ID FROM STEP 3` bit.
7. Get your Discord Guild/Server's ID and save that to `.env` as `DISCORD_SERVER_ID`

## EventBrite

1. Log into EventBrite.com
2. Go to Account Settings - Developer Links - API Keys ( https://www.eventbrite.com/account-settings/apps )
3. Create API Key. For Application URL put in your website or Discord Invite URL, whatever works.
4. Get an oAuth Token from ( https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/docs/authentication#get-a-private-token ), save that token to your `.env` as `EVENTBRITE_PERSONAL_OAUTH_TOKEN`
5. Run the EventBrite API to get `/events/${some-event-id}` to see your Org ID in the API. Save that to your `.env` as `EVENTBRITE_ORGANIZATION_API_ID`
